!epilepsy warning! zooming flashing lights & colors 


Dendrite opens up a new dimension of organization... 


...the fractal dimension....


this is an open-source software in early alpha, we are looking to grow our team!

# How-to use Dendrite (a fractal mind-map)

CLICK AND DRAG to move around the fractal.

SCROLL WHEEL, or PINCH on touchpad zooms.

SHIFT + SCROLL on a window to re-scale. (make sure you hover on the tab. this is can be difficult with videos and pdfs right now)

ALT + SCROLL to rotate

Dendrite embeddeds text, photos, audio, video, pdfs, or any i-frame content onto a rendering of the Mandelbrot set. (this includes any ai chatbot where the i-frame is not blocked) If you're having trouble, give chat-gpt the link you want to embed and ask it to convert the link to an iframe

Files can be dragged and dropped into the fractal from your local files, or embed links can be copied and pasted onto the fractal. (Make sure its an embed link)

(to be added soon, embed link conversion from normal link formats)

DOUBLE CLICK on a window to 'anchor' the window in place.

- Toggle 'Node-Mode' by holding shift.

'Node-Mode' allows for windows to be connected together.
To link two windows, hold shift, click on the first window, then click on the second window you would like to connecct.

While holding shift to enable 'Node-Mode', SCROLL or PINCH on a window to resize it.

Opening the menu bar in the top right of the screen gives access to further controls.

- Search

Type into the search bar to locate windows which contain that text.
A list of search results will display to the left of the menu. Currently, found windows are listed as numbers.
Clicking on a search result will zoom your view window to where the window is positioned and scalled within the Mandelbrot set (fractal)

- Saving 

Saving is still being improved. There are ways to save your text mappings; however, other conetnt currently has to be reinserted.

Text windows and the connections between windows can be saved by pressing save, 
then triple clicking the text box below the save button and copying its entire content.
That copied text can then be saved in a text file and repasted in to Dendrite!

To reload the text windows and their connections...
...take the text you got from the save button and paste it back into the textbox, making sure to replace any text that was already there.

- Zettelkasten

A zettlekasten ('slip box' in German) is a note-taking approach popularized by Niklas Luhmann. His note identification technique is credited as the tool which enabled his prolific scientific output. 

You can use the textbox at the bottom of the menu to create text windows and connections purely via text input.
the #node: and #ref: tags can be modified to any desired character or word.

Format text in the Zettelkasten like this... 

node: title 1

type plain text

node: title 2

plain text
ref: title 1

the above formatting will create two connected text windows within the fractal graph viewer. 
If you update a note within the fractal it will also updtae the Zettelkasten. (currently works for nodes first created within the Zettelkasten)

All of these features are still in alpha. Refreshing the page will reset your graph over.


The Future of Dendrite

Dendrite is just getting started. 

The app is a recursive environment to generate ideas. As we are in the middle of a rapid acceleration in AI developement, new tools to visualize and organize information will be become ever more necessary. I believe that Dendrite can serve as an open-source playground for the future of data.

- ai integration
- deeper zoom
- markdown/textediting
- working color selection
- customizability/accessability
- auto embed formats
- custom equations for the fractal
- drawing-tool
- drag handles
- user feeback/bug fixes
- pdf.js
