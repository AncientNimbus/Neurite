!epilepsy warning! zooming flashing lights & colors 


Neurite opens up a new dimension of organization... 


...the fractal dimension....


this is an open-source software in early alpha, we are looking to grow our team!

# How-to use Neurite

Neurite embeddeds text, photos, audio, video, pdfs, or any i-frame content onto a rendering of the Mandelbrot set.

Files can be dragged and dropped into the fractal from your local files, or embed links can be copied and pasted onto the fractal. (Make sure its an embed link)

- Ai Driven Note Taking with embeddings.

Neurite has evolved into an advanced cognitive architecture for Large Language Models that runs directly in the browser.

To use the ai, you will need an OpenAi API key. (More LLM models to be supported in the future)

The Ai's responses are formatted to produce notes and connection within the fractal mind map.
This form of prompting leads to an emergent graph structure that represents the Ai's memory.

The Ai currently has the following capabilities... 

1. Auto Mode
2. Node based memory retrieval that allows for long term conversation context.
3. HTML/JS and In-browser Python (pyodide) environment for directly rendering GPT's code output.
4. Web Search (requires google programmable search api key and search engine id)
(to search without an API key, send a url within the prompt input and the webpage will display without going through Google.)
5. Webpage and PDF text extraction. (requires setting up the 'scrape' local-host server found in the repo)
6. Wikipedia Summaries (Requires setting up the 'wiki-server' found in the repo)
7. Wolfram Alpha Results. (Requires an API key and setting up the 'wolfram-server' in the repo)

All API keys can be input through the Ai tab of the menu dropdown.

Setting up the Wikipedia localhost requires python.

The Wolfram server and web scrape server require python and node.js
(more info on setting up servers in the README for each server.)

You can still use Neurite without any servers running, but Wolfram, Wiki, and Webpage extractions will not work.

In the '?' tab, the AI HOW-TO checkbox will send a context message to the ai which allows it to answer questions about Neurite.

- Search

Type into the search bar to locate windows which contain that text.
A list of search results will display to the left of the menu. Currently, found windows are listed as numbers.
Clicking on a search result will zoom your view window to where the window is positioned and scalled within the Mandelbrot set (fractal)

- Saving 

Saving is still being improved. There are ways to save your text mappings; however, other content (images, videos, webpages) will currently have to be re-inserted.

Text windows and the connections between windows can be saved in the settings tab by pressing save...
...then triple clicking the text box below the save button and copying its entire content.
That copied text can then be saved in a text file and repasted back in to Neurite.

To reload the text windows and their connections...
...repaste stored text from the save input and paste it back into the save input, making sure to replace any text that was already there. Then, click Load, and the text-nodes will be restored from your save-file.

- Zettelkasten

A zettlekasten ('slip box' in German) is a note-taking approach popularized by Niklas Luhmann. His note identification technique is credited as the tool which enabled his prolific scientific output. 
Many great thinkers have utilized this form of note-taking. Now, LLMs can too. 

# The Future of Neurite


The app is a recursive environment to generate ideas. As we are in the middle of a rapid acceleration in AI developement, new tools to visualize and organize information will be become ever more necessary.

- deeper zoom
- markdown/textediting
- color selection
- customizability/accessability
- auto embed formats
- custom equations for the fractal
- drawing-tool
- user feeback/bug fixes
