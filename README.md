WARNING: Neurite contains zooming, flashing lights, and colors which may not be suitable for people with photosensitive epilepsy.


💡 Neurite opens up a new dimension of organization... 


...the fractal dimension....


🚧 this is an open-source software in early alpha, we are looking to grow our team! 🚧

# How-to use Neurite

📚 Neurite lets you embed anything - text, photos, audio, video, PDFs, or i-frame content - onto a rendering of the Mandelbrot set. You can either drag and drop files from your local system or paste embed links straight onto the fractal. Be sure the links are embeddable!

#🚀 FractalGPT

- Ai Driven Note Taking.

Neurite has evolved into an advanced cognitive architecture for Large Language Models that runs directly in the browser.

To interact with the Ai, you will need an OpenAi API key. (More LLM models to be supported in the future)

The LLM’s responses format themselves into notes and connections within the fractal mind map, leading to an emergent graph structure that represents the AI’s memory.
Breaking up the ai's output into a chain of thought reasoning is one of a number of methods that correlate to improved Ai response.
The Zettelkasten parsing method combined with vector embedding search allows for arbitrary time-distance memory.
The Mandelbrot set acts as the terrain for your mind-map to grow into an interconnected tapestry of throught.


The Ai currently has the following capabilities... 

1. Auto Mode
2. Node based memory retrieval that allows for long term conversation context.
3. HTML/JS and In-browser Python (pyodide) environment for directly rendering GPT's code output.
4. Web Search (requires google programmable search api key and search engine id)
(to search without an API key, send a url within the prompt input and the webpage will display without going through Google.)
5. Webpage and PDF text extraction. (requires setting up the 'scrape' local-host server found in the repo)
6. Wikipedia Summaries (Requires setting up the 'wiki-server' found in the repo)
7. Wolfram Alpha Results. (Requires an API key and setting up the 'wolfram-server' in the repo)

All API keys can be input through the Ai tab of the menu dropdown.

We have recently included an Ai node funcitonality.
Alt + Double click creates a node with a more traditional ai chat interface. (you can create multiple)
The Ai node will retain the context for any other text or Ai nodes that are connected to it.

# Local Server Setup
- To set up the Wikipedia, Wolfram, and web scrape servers, you will require Python and Node.js. You can find more info on setting up servers in the README for each server.
- Without any servers running, Wolfram, Wiki, and Webpage extractions will not function.

In the '?' tab, the AI HOW-TO checkbox will send a context message to the ai which allows it to answer questions about Neurite.

#🔍 User Guide
-Search: Enter a search query to locate windows containing that text. A list of search results will display to the left of the menu. Click on a search result to zoom your view window to where the window is positioned and scaled within the Mandelbrot set (fractal).
- Saving: Saving is currently a work-in-progress. Text windows and connections between windows can be saved via the Settings tab. Non-textual content currently needs to be re-inserted.
- Zettelkasten: The Zettelkasten method enables nodes to be created by typing into the main text area. The ai follows this format to create and connect its responses together. This allows for a tree of thought reasoning process within the Mandelbrot set.

# The Future of Neurite


Neurite is a recursive environment for generating ideas. As we are in the middle of a rapid acceleration in AI developement, new tools to visualize and organize information will become ever more necessary.
