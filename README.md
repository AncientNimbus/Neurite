Neurite opens up a new dimension of organization... 


...the fractal dimension....


this is an open-source software in early alpha, we are looking to grow our team!

# How-to use Neurite

Neurite embeddeds text, photos, audio, video, pdfs, or any i-frame content onto a rendering of the Mandelbrot set.

Files can be dragged and dropped into the fractal from your local files, or embed links can be copied and pasted onto the fractal. (Make sure its an embed link)

# FractalGPT

- Ai Driven Note Taking with embeddings.

Neurite has evolved into an advanced cognitive architecture for Large Language Models that runs directly in the browser.

To interact with the Ai, you will need an OpenAi API key. (More LLM models to be supported in the future)

The LLM’s responses format themselves into notes and connections within the fractal mind map, leading to an emergent graph structure that represents the AI’s memory.

The Ai currently has the following capabilities... 

1. Auto Mode
2. Node based memory retrieval that allows for long term conversation context.
3. HTML/JS and In-browser Python (pyodide) environment for directly rendering GPT's code output.
4. Web Search (requires google programmable search api key and search engine id)
(to search without an API key, send a url within the prompt input and the webpage will display without going through Google.)
5. Webpage and PDF text extraction. (requires setting up the 'scrape' local-host server found in the repo)
6. Wikipedia Summaries (Requires setting up the 'wiki-server' found in the repo)
7. Wolfram Alpha Results. (Requires an API key and setting up the 'wolfram-server' in the repo)

All API keys can be input through the Ai tab of the menu dropdown.

# Local Server Setup
- To set up the Wikipedia, Wolfram, and web scrape servers, you will require Python and Node.js. You can find more info on setting up servers in the README for each server.
- Without any servers running, Wolfram, Wiki, and Webpage extractions will not function.

In the '?' tab, the AI HOW-TO checkbox will send a context message to the ai which allows it to answer questions about Neurite.

# User Guide
- Search: Enter a search query to locate windows containing that text. A list of search results will display to the left of the menu. Click on a search result to zoom your view window to where the window is positioned and scaled within the Mandelbrot set (fractal).
- Saving: Saving is currently a work-in-progress. Text windows and connections between windows can be saved via the Settings tab. Non-textual content currently needs to be re-inserted.
- Zettelkasten: The Zettelkasten method enables nodes to be created by typing into the main text area. The ai follows this format to create and connect its responses together. This allows for a tree of thought reasoning process within the Mandelbrot set.

# The Future of Neurite


The app is a recursive environment to generate ideas. As we are in the middle of a rapid acceleration in AI developement, new tools to visualize and organize information will be become ever more necessary.

- deeper zoom
- markdown/textediting
- color selection
- customizability/accessability
- auto embed formats
- custom equations for the fractal
- drawing-tool
- user feeback/bug fixes
