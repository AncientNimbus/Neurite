# Fractal-MindMap
!epilepsy warning! flashing lights & colors -software in alpha...there are many further iterations to develop-


Fractal-MindMap adds a new dimension of organization to the internet... 


...the fractal dimension....


-  How-to Fractal-MindMap 

CLICK AND DRAG to move around the fractal.
SCROLL WHEEL, or PINCH on touchpad zooms.

Fractal-MindMap embeddeds text, photos, audio, video, pdfs, or any i-frame content onto a rendering of the Mandelbrot set.

Files can be dragged and dropped into the fractal from your local files, or embed links can be copied and pasted onto the fractal.
(to-add, support embed conversion from normal link formats)

DOUBLE CLICK on a window to 'anchor' it in place.

- Toggle 'Node-Mode' by holding shift.

'Node-Mode' allows for windows to be connected together.
To link two windows, hold shift, click on the first window, then click on the second window you would like to connecct.

While holding shift to enable 'Node-Mode', SCROLL or PINCH on a window to resize it.

Opening the menu bar in the top right of the screen gives access to further controls.

- Search

Type into the search bar to locate windows which contain that text.
A list of search results will display to the left of the menu. Currently, found windows are listed as numbers.
Clicking on a search result will zoom your view window to where the window is positioned and scalled within the Mandelbrot set (fractal)

- Saving 

Saving is still being improved.

Currently, text windows and the connections between windows can be saved by pressing save, 
then triple clicking the text box below the save button and copying its entire content.
That copied text can then be saved in a text file. 

To reload the text windows and their connections...
take the text you got from the save button and paste it back into the textbox, replacing any text that was already there.

- Zettelkasten

You can use the textbox at the bottom of the menu to generrate nodes and connections purely via text input.
the #node: and #ref: tags can be modified to any character desired
Format like this... 

#node: title 1

type plain text

#node: title 2

plain text
ref: title 1

this formatting will create two connected text windows within the fractal graph viewer. 

All of these features are still in alpha. Refreshing the page will reset your graph from the start.
